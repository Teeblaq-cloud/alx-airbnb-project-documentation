1.  As a user (guest or host), I want a comprehensive and easy-to-use platform so that I can seamlessly find, book, or list properties and manage my interactions, payments, and experiences.

2.  As a guest, I want to easily search for, book, and pay for suitable properties, manage my bookings, and share my experiences through reviews so that I can have a comfortable and secure travel accommodation experience.

3.  As a host, I want to easily list and manage my properties, accept bookings, handle payments securely, and interact with guests so that I can effectively monetize my properties and provide a positive experience.

4.  As an administrator, I want to oversee and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments so that I can ensure the smooth, secure, and efficient operation of the platform.

5.  As a host, I want to create, edit, and delete my property listings (including details like photos, descriptions, amenities, pricing, and availability) so that I can manage the properties I rent out.

6.  As a user (guest or host), I want to receive email and in-app notifications for key events (booking confirmations, payment receipts, cancellations, etc.) so that Iâ€™m promptly informed of important updates.
